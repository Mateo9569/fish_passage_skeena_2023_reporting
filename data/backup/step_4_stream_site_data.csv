Overall very nice stream, good flows, plentiful habitat. Large woody debris jam was big but had water running under."

However still a nice mix of habitat available including periodic undercut banks and lots of overhanging vegetation. Gradient relatively stable at 4 degrees although there were some woody debris jams which could impede travel on some flows. One fish sighted in outlet pool.
