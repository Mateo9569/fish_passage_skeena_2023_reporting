#combining pit tag data to individual fish data so that we can copy and paste directly into submission template
# would be good to include the comments and times/camera of photos in the fish csv and then paste them to the right of the pit tag.

# using readr is better than read.csv
# looks like tag_01_01 reads in with a column named tag but tag_01_02 does not have a column name
# for that reason the call to read_csv needs to be different (change col_names to F for that file).
# you will need to change the name of the column that gets separated and the slice row below will not likely be necessary
